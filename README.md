# GeoHealth Social Platform
A geospatial application that uses social media data for health analytics. The immediate goal was to advance the understanding of opioid epidemics in an area of interest. This project started as a class project taught by Dr. Luis Bermudez at UMBC [GES 771: Advanced Spatial Data Management](http://shadygrove.umbc.edu/gis/courses.php). It was sonsored by [HSR](http://healthsolutionsresearch.org/).
