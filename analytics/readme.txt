Nephtali - I ran my searches using a python script (not the same as Xiu's, I hadn't seen hers yet).  
I've uploaded the resulting JSON files here in case we want to use them for practice with the geocoding.

I used these coordinates/radii as regions: 
Baltimore:39.283333,-76.616667,50km
Western MD:39.4689151,-77.4500538,26km
Southern MD:38.708889,-76.335,50km
Southeast MD:38.1756072,-75.5437228,45km
Panhandle:39.660027,-78.7818776,60km

Xiu Xiu - 
I ran 8 searches per location.  You won't have to do as many for Nephtali's keyword.  So these are the ones you can run for each of the locations above: 
	(need OR want OR needing OR wanting) AND (opioids OR narcan OR overdose OR opioidcrisis OR recovery OR formeraddict)
	(too many OR two OR three OR double OR too much OR overdose OR crash OR strong enough OR max OR too many) AND (opioids OR narcan OR overdose OR opioidcrisis OR recovery OR formeraddict)
	(enough OR pop OR popping OR not enough OR another OR popped) AND (opioids OR narcan OR overdose OR opioidcrisis OR recovery OR formeraddict)
	(buy OR sell OR trade OR share OR spend OR bring OR steal) AND (opioids OR narcan OR overdose OR opioidcrisis OR recovery OR formeraddict)
