Nephtali - I ran my searches using a python script (not the same as Xiu's, I hadn't seen hers yet).  I've uploaded the resulting JSON files here in case we want to use them for practice with the geocoding.

I used these coordinates/radii as regions: 
Baltimore:39.283333,-76.616667,50km
Western MD:39.4689151,-77.4500538,26km
Southern MD:38.708889,-76.335,50km
Southeast MD:38.1756072,-75.5437228,45km
Panhandle:39.660027,-78.7818776,60km
